Ethenet-Ethenet Direct Connection
=================================

- First configure your desktop client to any  IP address except 192.168.1.150 as this address is assigned to your connected VIBE by default. ( we are using 192.168.1.151 for our PC client)


- Connect VIBE to the PC client via ethernet port.

- Setup ppp0 connection. You can refer the same document under
[Setting PPP connections](https://amanyantrr.github.io/testmkdocs5/)

- Then you have to assign gateway IP address of your PC client as 192.168.1.150 for direct communication between client and VIBE.
- For this you have to type

         # nano /etc/network/interfaces

- A text editor will get open and then you have to configure the settings as per your requirements.( gateway IP address must be  by default. ( we are using 192.168.1.151 for our PC client)

         # wpa-ssid "essid"
         # wpa-psk  "password"

         case, to completely disable remove file [run_boot-scripts] from the b$
         iface usb0 inet static# Ethernet/RNDIS gadget (g_ether)
         # ... or on host side, usbnet and random hwaddr
         # Note on some boards, usb0 is automatically setup with an init script
         # in that# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
         # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

         # The loopback network interface
         auto lo
         iface lo inet loopback

         # The primary network interface
         auto eth0
         # iface eth0 inet dhcp
         # Example to keep MAC address between reboots
         # hwaddress ether DE:AD:BE:EF:CA:FE
         iface eth0 inet static
         address 192.168.1.151
         netmask 255.255.255.0
         network 192.168.1.0
         gateway 192.168.1.150

- Now for confirmation, ping 192.168.1.150 using your PC client as well as ping 192.168.1.151( PC client) using VIBE.
- Log into VIBE via ethernet port using your PC client as root client.
